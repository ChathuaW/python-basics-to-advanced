# Python Basics to Advanced 🐍  
A personal Python learning journey with practice code & projects

This repository contains all the Python codes I practiced while learning Python from **beginner to advanced level**.  
The lessons and projects were inspired by YouTube tutorials, but the coding has been **done and organized by me** for practice and reference.  

## 📖 What’s Inside  

Basics: variables, data types, casting, user input  
Control flow: if/else, loops, logical operators  
Data structures: lists, sets, tuples, dictionaries  
Functions & arguments (*args, **kwargs)  
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
File handling & exception handling  
Multithreading, APIs, decorators  
GUI apps with PyQt5  
Projects: calculator, games, banking app, encryption, alarm clock, digital clock, weather app, and more!

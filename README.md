# Python Basics to Advanced 🐍  
A personal Python learning journey with practice code & projects

This repository contains all the Python codes I practiced while learning Python from **beginner to advanced level**.  
The lessons and projects were inspired by YouTube tutorials, but the coding has been **done and organized by me** for practice and reference.  

## 📖 What’s Inside  

1. Basics: variables, data types, casting, user input  
2. Control flow: if/else, loops, logical operators  
3. Data structures: lists, sets, tuples, dictionaries  
4. Functions & arguments (*args, **kwargs)  
5. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
6. File handling & exception handling  
7. Multithreading, APIs, decorators  
8. GUI apps with PyQt5  
9. Projects: calculator, games, banking app, encryption, alarm clock, digital clock, weather app, and more!
